# Assignment: Ridge Regression

## Overview
This assignment shows us how to perform Ridge Regression using the `Hitters` dataset from the `ISLR` package in R. It involves data cleaning, fitting the Ridge Regression model, and evaluating its performance.

## Key Concepts
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning the dataset by removing missing values and selecting relevant predictors.
- **Ridge Regression**: Applying Ridge Regression to predict player salaries while addressing multicollinearity.
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Assessing multicollinearity among predictor variables.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing OLS and Ridge Regression models and interpreting coefficients.

## How to Run
- Open `Ridge_Regression.R` in RStudio.
- Install the required packages by running the installation commands included in the R code.
- Execute the code to perform data analysis, model fitting, and generate outputs.

## Dataset
- This assignment uses the `Hitters` dataset from the `ISLR` package, which includes player performance metrics and salaries. The dataset is cleaned and subset within the code for our data analysis.
